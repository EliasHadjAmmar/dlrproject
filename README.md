#### Using the repository:
 - Clone the repository:
    - `git clone https://<your git username>@github.com/EliasHadjAmmar/dlrproject.git`, or
    - or manually in GitHub Desktop.
    - If you're using a Mac, do not synch your GitHub folder with iCloud. Go to "System Preferences/iCloud/iCloud drive/options" to see which folders are linked with iCloud. When cloning the repository, specify a path which is not in one of these folders.
 - Have Google Drive Desktop downloaded onto the local machine, and the shared `ifoHack2023` folder synced.
 - Create a link from the Google Drive folder to a 'drive' folder in GitHub. This way we can access shared files from the GitHub folder.
    - `mklink /J PATH-TO-REPO\drive\ PATH-TO-DRIVE` in the Windows command prompt.
    - [Symlink](https://www.howtogeek.com/297721/how-to-create-and-use-symbolic-links-aka-symlinks-on-a-mac/) `ln -s PATH-TO-DRIVE PATH-TO-REPO/drive` in the Mac terminal.
    - (To not have to type paths:) You can drag-and-drop folders from the Finder/Explorer to the command prompt/terminal to get file paths.
 
 #### Storage:
 Output files should be stored in the `drive` folder.
